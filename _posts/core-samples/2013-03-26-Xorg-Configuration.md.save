In this article, we focus on some basic and foundational introduction about the X11 related topics in our linux experience.  
####Xorg Server ####
There are mainly two sub\-sections in the Xorg Server section. firstly, I will conduct some introduction and explanation about the history and roles Xorg take in our hole GUI system. secondly, I'll give a practical example to show the process of problem trackback and solved. 

#### Login Manager or Display Manager ####
To some kinds, when you setup the xorg server and install the Window manager or Desktop Environment you could start the X11 system with just a command `start x`. But if you want the show the GUI graphic system all the way, and you won't want to start the x system in console, you need the help of **Login manger**, the default login manager for the Gnome is gdm. and correspondly, for Fluxbox, the slim is an ideal choice. Just with these simple line, you could use it.  
	
	equo install x11-misc/slim
	vim /etc/conf.d/xdm
and the make the change of the following:, which is the core of choice.

	---
	DISPLAYMANAGER="slim"
	---
finally, you should add the xdm to default run\-levels.

	rc-update add xdm default  

Also you should need to set the $XSession variable, for the default 
sessions when login with slim. the common and the most method is:  
	cp /etc/X11/Sessions/fluxbox ~/.xsession
And after this, you will be able to login fluxbox with slim.

#### Troubleshoting ####
once installed the sabayon system, I attempt to upgrade the system 
according to the instrument by the equo, `equo update`, however, 
problems arase when I restart the system. I just cannot start the window 
display manager\(also login manager\). so when I invoke the xorg log in 
directory: `/var/log/Xorg.0.log/`, to find the problems, the first time, 
I infer that it's maybe the problem of Xorg configure files accroding to 
the last two error line: Screen0 cannot find.  
Then I attempt to reveal the whole process of installing the xorg on 
gentoo documentation.  
#####History of Xorg#####
The X.org project provides an open implementation of X window System.
