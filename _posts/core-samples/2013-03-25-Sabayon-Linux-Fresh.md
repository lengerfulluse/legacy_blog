When [**Gentoo**](http://www.gentoo.org) beckons to you, follows him. Though his ways are hard and steep.   
Thanks for the instruction from **Ryan Li** at *RedHat* Co.td during my internship, I stepped on a nice 
journal companied by **Gentoo** linux distribution. `If it moves, Just compiles it`. All the way, I finally understand the reason
why lots of guys are so addicted by the linux, by gentoo linux respecially. Althought the journal is full of uncetain hardships, The exciting 
of achievement is beyond all these things. When you came over all the way, I can have fruitness harvest which are not only the knowledge or 
some cool skills you got, But another most important things in your life,  the courage to conquer every things, the belief to complete tasks 
efficiently and perfectly. If we compare life to be a war, It is the wapean that determines the success or failure. Similarly, proper tools 
for our daily work is extremly improtant, I used to be curious about every linux distribution, for instance, **Ubuntu**, **OpenSuse**, 
**FreeBSD**, **Backtrack**, **ArchLinux**, all for the desktop environment too, **Gnome**, **KDE**, **Xfce**, **Awesome** etc. not to say a 
lot of application tools, shell and so much others. However, it's just to be dispointed that I just cannot stop my step to get further on some 
particular useful tools. Exactly, I was always too shallow.   
One of my shortcomings is that I cannot pay attention on the same things for a long time. Bla bla bla, yea, you are right, it's just like a 
child, right? To be honesly, this habits frustrates me all the time. In the other hand, it's the necessary quality for the exploiters. It's 
because of this, that I have the opportunity to explore a lot of amazing zones of the linux world.  
Yes, it is the first time I encounter the sabayon linux distribution. yesterday, I miss the **Gentoo** so much, so I logged into my Google 
plus account, and enter the search bar to find some interest news about the gentoo, It's amzing that the second result of my query is sabayon, 
I was very curous about what a kind of distribution it is How can it display here?

#### What distinguish a different distribution for me ####
I admit that what a linux actually attracts me is just about two aspects:
- *theme&appearence* You may think that this is a so shallow point, yes, it does. I come contacted with linux since when I was a freshman in 
[**NUPT**](www.njupt.edu.cn). What attracted me a lot lies in that the compize's cool cubic destkop effects. However, I don't like it's theme 
appearence, So in the next tries, I try other linux distribution mentioned above.
- *mirror source&package manager* It means that how convient it bring to you. Imagine that when you want to install a software for your work,
