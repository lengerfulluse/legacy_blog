When [**Gentoo**](http://www.gentoo.org) beckons to you, follows him. Though his ways are hard and steep.   
Thanks for the instruction from **Ryan Li** at *RedHat* Co.td during my internship, I stepped on a nice 
journal companied by **Gentoo** linux distribution. `If it moves, Just compiles it`. All the way, I finally understand the reason
why lots of guys are so addicted by the linux, by gentoo linux respecially. Althought the journal is full of uncetain hardships, The exciting 
of achievement is beyond all these things. When you came over all the way, I can have fruitness harvest which are not only the knowledge or 
some cool skills you got, But another most important things in your life,  the courage to conquer every things, the belief to complete tasks 
efficiently and perfectly. If we compare life to be a war, It is the wapean that determines the success or failure. Similarly, proper tools 
for our daily work is extremly improtant, I used to be curious about every linux distribution, for instance, **Ubuntu**, **OpenSuse**, 
**FreeBSD**, **Backtrack**, **ArchLinux**, all for the desktop environment too, **Gnome**, **KDE**, **Xfce**, **Awesome** etc. not to say a 
lot of application tools, shell and so much others. However, it's just to be dispointed that I just cannot stop my step to get further on some 
particular useful tools. Exactly, I was always too shallow.
