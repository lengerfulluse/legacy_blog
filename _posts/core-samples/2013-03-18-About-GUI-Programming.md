I couldn't remember what's exact the time, when I begin learning to do comparison between different but similar things. there is obvious no exception for the computer programming. Especially for GUI programming.
#### Since GUI Road ####
I do remember the sence that when I first met the GUI programming. It laid a deep impression on my mind. Since then, you recognized that you can do such beautiful and professional\(seems like\) windows interface yourself.  
Just like many modern normal college students, the materials where you first encountered programming are basically textbook. As a consideration of your low\-level computer skills, Unix-like OS just makes most people tedious and be kept away naturally.  
One of most important member in Windows eco-systems, MFC become my first station in GUI programing travel. Before that, I were very curious about the principal of how can people can implement such complicated windows system with just simple syntax of program languages. How just all that things works\!  So, in summar of 2009, for the sake of Image CUP of NUPT, I begin a nice travel with about one month time. How perfect that time!  
Last year, I gave another attempt about GUI in java awt and Swing framework, the whole process is surface and short. Except that I was tried by all these framework and their logic relations and event sequence.  
Recently, It's maybe partly caused by the great intrest about **Python** language, it's nice syntax and board applications programming fields appeals me a lot.  So when encount the same situation of indexing and searching modualr implementation, I just truned around to another new pypass. I decided to try something new, **wxPython** GUI framework. To be honestly, It's not an easy way, which makes me rethink the natural things about the GUI programming themselves, not just the personnal detailed modular or funtions.  
A good story just starts...   

#### **App** or **Window** or **Document**
